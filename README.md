# _Airspace_ for Jekyll
![screenshot](screenshots/home.png "Description goes here")

This Jekyll theme is a port of ThemeFisher's Airspace template. It is released under ThemeFisher's free license, which requires attribution.

## Usage
To start your project, [fork this respository](https://github.com/luminousrubyist/airspace-jekyll/fork), put in your content, and go!

## Remembering how to work with the dang thing
`jekyll serve --watch` to build and test locally.

Make changes on master or another topic branch, commit and push to origin. then `cd` to the `_site` directory and commit and push changes there (this goes to the `gh_pages` branch on GitHub). This should probably be revised to be less stupid, but it is functional for now.
